    <h3>What It Takes to Grow a Business</h3>

    <h5>
      “Growth Marketing is more than a strategy, it’s an expansion mindset.” 
      <br/>– Mehak V.
      <br/><br/> 
What does it take to grow a business? In the myrad of do’s and don’t’s, have-to do’s and what to do’s in the industry, Growing a business can quickly tangle you in every direction. To smooth it out, Let’s break business down into its simple components. Hence: the market. A market consists of the (product or service) provider; the (user, client, or customer) consumer; and a platform (or many) to make the exchange (or lead up to an exchange). The key to growing any business is in these 3 components. It is in experimenting ways to enhance those 3 market components and their relationships to one another; analyzing the data; and taking informed action. It take an expansion mindset to grow a business and avid trial and error. To dive into the science of experimentation, we begin with asking questions. Here are a few questions to ask to start the trail and error process:
<br/> <br/> 1.	Consumer 
<br/> a.	Who is your target user?, where are they, what are they thinking, and what are they are doing?

<br/> <br/> 2.	Product
<br/> a.	What is the quality value vs market value of your product/service? In comparison to your competitors?

<br/> <br/> 3.	Platform 
<br/> a.	Is your user experience (UX) fluid and engaging? Is it performing across devices?
<br/> 
<br/> <br/> 4.	Product | Consumer
<br/> a.	Where does the product/service fit in supply and demand?
<br/> b.	Can your target user afford the market value of your service/product?
<br/> 
<br/> 5.	Consumer | Platform 
<br/> a.	Where are we gaining and where are we losing consumers in the UX of the platform?
<br/> b.	Are the users properly funneling through the platform?

<br/> <br/> 6.	Platform | Product
<br/> a.	How easy is it to automate the marketing and funneling in the platforms you are using?
<br/> b.	Do your platforms clearly convey your product/service?
<br/> 
<br/> What I consider the most important question to ask:
<br/> <br/> 7.	Platform | Consumer | Product 
<br/> a.	Is the product/service accessible from every angle of discovery acquisition?
<br/> <br/> Experimentation questions are infinite. They are essential for growth marketing. Asking questions and conducting experiments allow us discover what works and what doesn’t for the business. Because growth marketing is data driven decision making – or as I like to call it, the integrative approach to adapting to our ever changing consumer. It takes asking questions about the market, listening to experiments, and adapting to the data. It takes a growth marketer to grow a business.
