    <h2 class="title">What It Takes to Grow a Business</h2>
      <br/>
    <h5 class="quote-text">
      “Growth Marketing is more than a strategy, it’s an expansion mindset.” 
      <br/>– Mehak V.
      <br/><br/> 
      <h5 class="body-text">
What does it take to grow a business? <br/>
Growing a business is unique to each business's development. However, how you approach it is the same. We take a look at 3 components of a market: the Product or Service, the Consumer, and the Platform to lead up to an exchange. We then ask questions evaluating each of the three components, hold experiments on the questions, analyze the data, and take inspired action. The key to growing a business is asking great questions, testing important changes, and taking action swiftly.  
<br/>
Here are questions I always like to ask about your market:
<br/> <br/> ->	The Consumer 
<br/> 	Who is your target user? I want to know everything about them. Where are they- What are they doing, thinking, and eating? Everything that makes them them, has to do with your business. What kind of content or marketing efforts best appeal to them?

<br/> <br/> ->	The Product
<br/> How does your product serve your consumer? What is the value that you are providing? What does your consumer think about your product?

<br/> <br/> ->	The Platform 
<br/> 	Are your platforms optimized for discovery? Do you have funnels set up for your consumer? How accessible is your product to your consumer? Is your user experience (UX) fluid and engaging enough for retention and referrals?
<br/> 
<br/> <br/>->	Your Competitors
<br/> 	What are your competitors doing to target your customer, enhance their product, or optimize their platforms?
<br/> 	
<br/> 
<br/> ->	In-House 
<br/> 	How can we maximize efficiency in-house? What operations can we delegate and or automate? 
<br/>
<br/> Additional Questions for Gaging Growth Marketing Efforts:
<br/>
      What is the conversion rate across platform funnels, our churn rate, and our growth rate? How can we strategize an effective marketing experience for your consumer?
<br/> 
<br/> By asking great questions, from basic to complex, we  open up new venues for improvement. The goal with growth marketing is not to blindly progress, but to determine with strong evidence, the best way to adapt to your market, and enhance your business for it.
<br/> <br/> Working with a Growth Marketer is working with someone who's main focus is enhancing your business. It's having a navigator- one who asses the waters and helps you take your business in the direction you desire. We work with a northstar compass, and we strategize a map & key for your business to follow, grow, and adapt. 
            Growing a business takes data driven decision making, it's the adaptive approach to serving our ever-changing market. It takes asking questions, listening to experiment results, and executing strategy based off those results. It takes a growth marketer to grow a business.
